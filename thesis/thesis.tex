% Transformace dat jsou důležitou součástí strojového učení, která výrazně ovlivňuje kvalitu vytvořených modelů. Transformace dat se často používají i pro jejich zobrazení do prostoru s menší dimenzí, kde se dají snáze vizualizovat. Většina metod ale funguje bez učitele a tedy není schopna najít taková zobrazení dat, která by brala v úvahu vlastnosti metod strojového učení, které následují po ní, případně se snažila vizualizaci upravit tak, aby data ze stejné třídy byla blízko u sebe. Některé metody určené přímo pro vizualizaci (jako např. t-SNE) navíc ani neposkytují transformační funkci a nejsou tedy schopny zobrazit nová data bez přepočítání celého zobrazení. Cílem práce je tedy pomocí kombinace evolučních algoritmů a dalších přístupů (např. neuronových sítí) navrhnout metody pro vytvoření transformační funkce, která bude brát v úvahu i označkování dat.

\addcontentsline{toc}{chapter}{Introduction}

The need for measuring distance or similarity between data is ubiquitous in machine learning and creating custom metrics by hand is very difficult process. This has led to an introduction of distance metric learning where we learn distance metrics or similarities from data themselves.

One of the popular metrics is Mahalanobis distance, which generalizes Euclidean distance with a parameter matrix. We examine methods for learning this Mahalanobis distance and compare their performance on common datasets.

\section{Motivation}

Curse of dimensionality, bad euclid distance

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\section{Goals}

\subsection{Foundation stone}

Many researches devoted to learn a Mahalanobis distance metric, which has mostly been used to improve the performance of kNN classification. Most of the research has been focused on learning this metric from labeled training instances.

In this thesis, we review existing state-of-the-art methods for learning global Mahalanobis distance metric (Xing, LMNN, NCA, ...) and multiple local Mahalanobis distance metrics (PLML, ...) and compare them on several popular datasets. Learning the full Mahalanobis metric means learning $d^2$ parameters and so we also try to restrict the existing methods to learn only a diagonal of the Mahalanobis distance metric with $d$ parameters.

There was no unified library containing the algorithms for learning the distance metrics and so we created a library with unified interface according to the current standards.

\subsection{Nice to have}

In the next part of our work we apply the known methods from supervised setting to semi-supervised where we have both labeled and unlabeled training instances. The idea is to use the Mahalanobis metric distance learnt from labeled pairs for clustering the unlabeled instances. It is possible (and very likely) that the unlabeled instances contain more classes.

We examine this for methods using global metrics and also for methods using multiple local distance metrics where we needed to adapt existing clustering algorithms for our multi-metric setting.

\subsection{Moonshot}

In the last section of the thesis we examined an iterative distance metric learning process consisting of these steps:
\begin{enumerate*}
\item{learning a distance metric from the labeled data}
\item{applying a non-supervised clustering method to obtain new labels (and possibldifferent number of classes)}
\item{repeat}
\end{enumerate*}
.

\chapter{Experiments and Examples}
We performed three different experiments to assess the performance of metric learning algorithms. In section \ref{chap:trivial-dataset} we showcase, where the metric learning algorithms perform very well on a trivial dataset. In section \ref{chap:exp:classification} we use learnt metric in k-Nearest~Neighbour classificator and compare classification errors on various datasets, which are described in \ref{chap:exp:datasets}. In the next experiment in section \ref{chap:exp:fitness} we compare different evolutionary algorithms together with various fitnesses and show how well they generalize. As the last experiment in section \ref{chap:exp:dimred} we use metric learning algorithms for dimensionality reduction and compare the resulting embeddings.

\section{Experimental settings} 
In our experiments we compare metric learning algorithms listed in section \ref{chap:rw}. Most of these algorithms are implemented in an open-sourced Python \textit{metric-learn} library \footnote{\url{https://github.com/all-umass/metric-learn}}. Only our evolutionary method described in section \ref{chap:our-method} and \cite{fukui2013evolutionary} are missing in this library. Therefore we designed a modular interface and implemented these two methods as a part of the \textit{metric-learn} library. The~implementation is described in section \ref{chap:impl}.

\subsection{Datasets} \label{chap:exp:datasets}
We chose to experiment on classification datasets that were most common among all related works, particularily \cite{xing2002distance}, \cite{weinberger2009distance}, \cite{jacobgoldberger2004neighbourhood} and \cite{fukui2013evolutionary}. We found that most common among all these papers was balance-scale, breast-cancer, iris, mice-protein, pima-indians, sonar and wine dataset. All these datasets were obtained from the well-known UCI Machine Learning Repository \footnote{\url{https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/}}. Even among these datasets mice-protein and sonar  have high dimensionality, however they are small in terms of number of samples.

We also added digits6 and digits10 datasets, which are relatively larger datasets containing $8\times 8$ pixel images of digits with 6 and 10 classes respectively. These datasets were obtained using Python library Scikit-Learn.org \footnote{\url{http://scikit-learn.org/stable/datasets/}}.

In order to test the metric learning algorithms on a highly variable data, we created an artificial dataset of four multinomial Gaussians. Each Gaussian has a different center, defined as a matrix in equation \eqref{eq:gauss:means} where each row corresponds to one center. All Gaussians were generated sharing one covariance matrix, defined in equation \eqref{eq:gauss:cov}. Dimensions are uncorrelated, however the first dimension has an enormous variability $10^8$.

\begin{equation} \label{eq:gauss:means}
means = \begin{pmatrix}
10 & 0 & 0 & 2 \\
0 & 10 & 0 & -2 \\
0 & 0 & 10 & -2 \\
0 & 0 & -10 & 2 \\
\end{pmatrix}
\end{equation}
\begin{equation} \label{eq:gauss:cov}
covariance = \begin{pmatrix}
10^8 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\
0 & 100 & 0 & 0 \\
0 & 0 & 2 & 0 \\
0 & 0 & 0 & 1 \\
\end{pmatrix}
\end{equation}

Table \ref{tab:datasets} summarizes datasets that we experimented on. The table shows number of samples, dimensionality and number of distinct classes for every dataset. The largest dataset in terms of number of samples and number of classes is digits10 dataset with 1797 samples. However the largest dataset in terms of number of dimensions is mice-protein dataset.

[Short info about all datasets we used? Multivariate, Real / Integer / Categorical, Missing data? %TODO

\subsection{Preprocessing data} \label{chap:exp:preprocessing}
Some of the datasets have missing attributes. There are several strategies for dealing with missing attributes, such as removing affected samples, filling missing values with a random value or zeros, their mean, median or the most frequent value. We chose to fill missing values using the mean for any given attribute as we found it behaves well with all chosen datasets.

\begin{table}[ht] \centering
\begin{tabular}{lrrrrr}
\hline
Dataset & minimum & maximum & mean & std. deviation \\
\hline

iris                    & 0.10  & 7.90    & 3.46  & 1.97 \\
mice-protein            & -0.06 & 8.48    & 0.68  & 0.79 \\
pima-indians            & 0.00  & 846.00  & 44.99 & 58.37 \\
sonar                   & 0.00  & 1.00    & 0.28  & 0.28 \\

\hline
\end{tabular}
\caption{Datasets samples statistics} \label{tab:datasets-samples}
\end{table}

Another difficulty with the datasets is that many of them do not have normalized attributes and their attribute values are unbounded and highly variable. From table \ref{tab:datasets-samples} it is clear that the most variable dataset is our artificial gaussians dataset, however pima-indians and wine datasets are also highly variable with a standard deviation of $58.37$ and $215.75$ respectively. The~datasets were normalized using standardization defined in equation \ref{eq:stand}, where $\mu$ is a mean vector for of each of the attributes and $\sigma$ is a vector of their standard deviations.

\begin{equation} \label{eq:stand}
\hat{X} = \frac{X-\mu}{\sigma}
\end{equation}

\section{Experiment: Classification} \label{chap:exp:classification}

In this experiment we wanted to see how much does learnt metric help in classification task compared to standard Euclidean distance. We chose k-Nearest~Neighbour (kNN) classifier, which is one of the simplest and yet powerful classifiers and it is very easy to modify to use a custom metric.

[list of methods that we used in the experiment] %TODO

To assess performance of the metric learning algorithms we used datasets listed in section \ref{chap:exp:datasets} and used 10-fold cross validation for each algorithm. For each fold data were first preprocessed and standardized as described in section \ref{chap:exp:preprocessing}, then the metric was trained using one of the methods and finally the metric was evaluated using kNN algorithm.

We also wanted to test, how does standardization influence the learnt metrics and whether the metric learning algorithms can handle unnormalized data and so we also tried all these experiments again, but without standardizing the data.

\subsection{Hyperperameter search} \label{chap:exp:hypsearch}

Every metric learning algorithm has a set of hyperparameters which highly influences the learnt metric. For each hyperparameter we selected sensible values from a reasonable range. All hyperparameters for each algorithm are described in table \ref{tab:hyperparams}. The performance of kNN classifier hugely depends on its number of neighbours hyperparameter. We chose to try values 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128 for this parameter.

\input{results/hyperparameters}

Even for these sensibly chosen hyperparameter values there are thousands of possible combinations for every single algorithm and thus we have to fit thousands of different models. Let’s consider LMNN algorithm: there are 10 folds, 8 possible values for the final kNN classifier hyperparameter, LMNN itself has 4 hyperparameters with 6, 3, 4 and 3 values, which means there would be $10*8*(6*3*4*3)=17280$ different models to train just for LMNN algorithm if a simple grid search was used. This is a major problem because some of the algorithms take a long time to train even on small datasets.

We can notice, however, that we do not need to retrain our metric for every hyperperameter of the final kNN classifier. Instead we can train a metric model first and then train and test kNN classifier with all hyperparameter options. Therefore, we designed our version of grid search that is hierarchical in a sense that it will train a metric with all combinations of hyperparameters first and only then it will evaluate these metrics using kNN with its own hyperparameters. There will still be the same total number of models, however there will be 8 times less evaluations of every metric learning algorithm, which roughly translates to 8 times less computation time as training kNN classifier is negligible compared to a metric model. This can be looked at as a simple space-time trade-off.

\section{Experiment: Generalization of EAs} \label{chap:exp:fitness}

To test out how well do solutions from evolution algorithms evolve and generalize we performed another series of tests. Using CMAES and jDE evolution strategies described in sections \ref{chap:ea:cmaes} and \ref{chap:ea:jde}, combined with k-Nearest~Neighbour (kNN) and weighted~F-measure (wFme) fitnesses described in sections @WHERE and \ref{chap:rw:fukui} respectively. Both strategies with both fitnesses were tested, giving us 4 different models: CMAES.kNN, CMAES.wFme, jDE.kNN and jDE.wFme.

All methods have several hyperparameters and in order to avoid the time consuming hyperparameter seach, the hyperparameters for the models in this experiment were picked according to results from the previous experiment.

Datasets described in section \ref{chap:exp:datasets} were used as well for this experiment. Data were preprocessed and standardized the same way as previous experiment, both methods are described in section \ref{chap:exp:preprocessing}. Data were split into training and testing sets using a 67:33 ratio in a stratified fashion, keeping the sizes of classes balanced between the two splits.

To gauge the performance of the fitness function we logged the fitness values of all individuals in every generation and then calculated median, minimum, maximum, 25th and 75th percentiles in each generation.

To see how well the individuals generalize, individuals with the best and the worst fitness values were picked in every generation and the metric encoded in these individuals was evaluated using the test set using kNN classifier.

\subsection{Results}

Both kNN and wFme fitness functions output values in a closed range $[0,1]$. The final kNN classifier used to gauge performance outputs values in the same exact range and so we plot all values in the same graph. Therefore the graph for each generation shows minimal and maximal (both in orange) fitnesses, median fitness (in green) with the area between 25th and 75th percentiles coloured with light green. The test successrate of the individual with the highest fitness in XX and the test successrate of the individual with the lowest fitness in XX.

% Genetic Algorithms are not chaotic, they are stochastic. The complexity depends on the genetic operators, their implementation (which may have a very significant effect on overall complexity), the representation of the individuals and the population, and obviously on the fitness function. Given the usual choices (point mutation, one point crossover, roulette wheel selection) a Genetic Algorithms complexity is O(g(nm + nm + n)) with g the number of generations, n the population size and m the size of the individuals. Therefore the complexity is on the order of O(gnm)). This is of cause ignoring the fitness function, which depends on the application.

Runtime of each method is an important factor to considered. Some methods are not very scalable for large datasets as already discussed in (@WHERE). As already mentioned (@WHERE) it is not easy to describe most of metric learning algorithms in big O notation because most of them are iterative and therefore it is not clear how many iterations is needed. Plus they can still end up in some local minima.

In table \ref{tab:runtimes} we show run times of every method for the best hyper-parameter combination, which corresponds to best error rate for given dataset as shown in table \ref{tab:errors-small}. Euclidean distance does not need any metric training and therefore has a zero runtime in the table. Covariance metric is the seconds fastest metric, closely followed by LFDA and RCA metrics. On the other hand, LMNN and NCA metrics and all evolution metrics are the slowest methods. NCA did not even finish on mice-protein, pima-indians, ionosphere and wine datasets.
