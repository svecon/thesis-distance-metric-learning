\chapter{Introduction} \label{introduction}
\addcontentsline{toc}{chapter}{Introduction}

The need for measuring distance or similarity between data is ubiquitous in machine learning and creating custom metrics by hand is very difficult process. This has led to an introduction of distance metric learning where we learn distance metrics or similarities from data themselves.

One of the popular metrics is Mahalanobis distance, which generalizes Euclidean distance with a parameter matrix. We examine methods for learning this Mahalanobis distance and compare their performance on common datasets.

\section{Goals}

\subsection{Foundation stone}

Many researches devoted to learn a Mahalanobis distance metric, which has mostly been used to improve the performance of kNN classification. Most of the research has been focused on learning this metric from labeled training instances.

In this thesis, we review existing state-of-the-art methods for learning global Mahalanobis distance metric (Xing, LMNN, NCA, ...) and multiple local Mahalanobis distance metrics (PLML, ...) and compare them on several popular datasets. Learning the full Mahalanobis metric means learning $d^2$ parameters and so we also try to restrict the existing methods to learn only a diagonal of the Mahalanobis distance metric with $d$ parameters.

There was no unified library containing the algorithms for learning the distance metrics and so we created a library with unified interface according to the current standards.

\subsection{Nice to have}

In the next part of our work we apply the known methods from supervised setting to semi-supervised where we have both labeled and unlabeled training instances. The idea is to use the Mahalanobis metric distance learnt from labeled pairs for clustering the unlabeled instances. It is possible (and very likely) that the unlabeled instances contain more classes.

We examine this for methods using global metrics and also for methods using multiple local distance metrics where we needed to adapt existing clustering algorithms for our multi-metric setting.

\subsection{Moonshot}

In the last section of the thesis we examined an iterative distance metric learning process consisting of these steps:
\begin{enumerate*}
\item{learning a distance metric from the labeled data}
\item{applying a non-supervised clustering method to obtain new labels (and possibldifferent number of classes)}
\item{repeat}
\end{enumerate*}
.
