\chapter{Methods}

In this work we chose to examine the following methods:

\begin{enumerate}
\item Simple Covariance Metric
\item Xing
\item Large Margin Nearest Neighbor (LMNN)
\item Information Theoretic Metric Learning (ITML)
\item Sparse Determinant Metric Learning (SDML)
\item Least Squares Metric Learning (LSML)
\item Neighborhood Components Analysis (NCA)
\item Local Fisher Discriminant Analysis (LFDA)
\item Relative Components Analysis (RCA)
\end{enumerate}

\chapter{Experiments}

Datasets that we used for our experiments from 

https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/:

We chose the basic datasets that were mentioned in the original papers.

balance-scale, breast-cancer-wisconsin, ionosphere, iris, mice-protein, pima-indians-diabetes, sonar, soybean-large, wine

\chapter{Discussion}

Graphs, performace, caveats, what worked, what didnt work...

LMNN, ITML, SDML take too long to calculate

LMNN and LFDA perform very well

LMNN has too many hyper parameters

Simple Covariance metric was impossible to calculate on certain datasets
