\chapter{Introduction}

The need for measuring distance or similarity between data is ubiquitous in machine learning and creating custom metrics by hand is very difficult process. This has led to an introduction of distance metric learning where we learn distance metrics or similarities from data themselves.

One of the popular metrics is Mahalanobis distance, which generalizes Euclidean distance with a parameter matrix. We examine methods for learning this Mahalanobis distance and compare their performance on common datasets.

\chapter{Methods}

In this work we chose to examine the following methods:

\begin{enumerate}
\item Simple Covariance Metric
\item \sout{Xing}
\item Large Margin Nearest Neighbor (LMNN)
\item Information Theoretic Metric Learning (ITML)
\item Sparse Determinant Metric Learning (SDML)
\item Least Squares Metric Learning (LSML)
\item Neighborhood Components Analysis (NCA)
\item Local Fisher Discriminant Analysis (LFDA)
\item \sout{Relative Components Analysis (RCA)}
\end{enumerate}

\chapter{Experiments}

Datasets that we used for our experiments from 
https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/:

We chose the basic datasets that were mentioned in the original papers.

balance-scale, breast-cancer-wisconsin, ionosphere, iris, mice-protein, pima-indians-diabetes, sonar, soybean-large, wine

\chapter{Discussion}

Graphs, performace, caveats, what worked, what didnt work...

LMNN, ITML, SDML take too long to calculate

LMNN and LFDA perform very well

LMNN has too many hyper parameters

Simple Covariance metric was impossible to calculate on certain datasets

\chapter{Conclusion}

This worked, this didn't work. What we did.
